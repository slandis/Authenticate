/* Authenticate */

A pretty straight forward (and quite possibly flawed) authentication implementation for php+sqlite.

Please use HTTPS/SSL for for your login pages, otherwise your passwords will be transmitted in plain text.

As with most of my code, any real documentation of how this works (if there is any at all) exists in the comments. Deal.

Have fun.
